== Scope

This document aims to provide guidance to assembly programmers targeting the
standard RISC-V assembly language, which common open-source assemblers like
GNU as and LLVM's assembler support. Other assemblers might not support the
same directives or pseudoinstructions; their dialects are outside the scope
of this document.
