ifeval::["{revlifecycle}" == "discussion"]
[WARNING]
.This document is in the link:http://riscv.org/spec-state[Discussion state]
====
Assume everything can change. This document is not complete yet and was created only
for the purpose of conversation outside of the document.

ifeval::["{revlifecycle}" == "dev"]
[WARNING]
.This document is in the link:http://riscv.org/spec-state[Development state]
====
Assume everything can change. This draft specification will change before being accepted
as standard, so implementations made to this draft specification will likely not conform
to the future standard.
====
endif::[]
ifeval::["{revlifecycle}" == "stable"]
[WARNING]
.This document is in the link:http://riscv.org/spec-state[Stable state]
====
Assume anything could still change, but limited change should be expected.
====
endif::[]
ifeval::["{revlifecycle}" == "frozen"]
.This document is in the link:http://riscv.org/spec-state[Frozen state]
====
Change is extremely unlikely. A high threshold will be used, and a change
will only occur because of some truly critical issue being identified during
the public review cycle. Any other desired or needed changes can be the subject
of a follow-on new extension.

endif::[]
ifeval::["{revlifecycle}" == "ratified"]
.This document is in the link:http://riscv.org/spec-state[Ratified state]
====
No changes are allowed. Any desired or needed changes can be the subject
of a follow-on new extension. Ratified extensions are never revised.
