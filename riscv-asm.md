# Command-Line Arguments

I think it's probably better to beef up the binutils documentation rather than
duplicating it here.

# Registers

Registers are the most important part of any processor. RISC-V defines various
types, depending on which extensions are included: The general registers (with
the program counter), control registers, floating point registers (F extension),
and vector registers (V extension).

## General registers 

The RV32I base integer ISA includes 32 registers, named `x0` to `x31`. The
program counter `PC` is separate from these registers, in contrast to other
processors such as the ARM-32. The first register, `x0`, has a special function:
Reading it always returns 0 and writes to it are ignored. As we will see later,
this allows various tricks and simplifications.

In practice, the programmer doesn't use this notation for the registers. Though
`x1` to `x31` are all equally general-use registers as far as the processor is
concerned, by convention certain registers are used for special tasks. In
assembler, they are given standardized names as part of the RISC-V **application
binary interface** (ABI). This is what you will usually see in code listings. If
you really want to see the numeric register names, the `-M` argument to objdump
will provide them.

Register  | ABI         | Use by convention                     | Preserved?
:-------- | :---------- | :---------------                      | ------
x0        | zero        | hardwired to 0, ignores writes        | _n/a_

_Registers of the RV32I. Based on RISC-V documentation and Patterson and
Waterman "The RISC-V Reader" (2017)_

As a general rule, the **saved registers** `s0` to `s11` are preserved across
function calls, while the **argument registers** `a0` to `a7` and the
**temporary registers** `t0` to `t6` are not.  The use of the various
specialized registers such as `sp` by convention will be discussed later in more
detail.

## Instruction Aliases

ALIAS line from opcodes/riscv-opc.c

To better diagnose situations where the program flow reaches an unexpected
location, you might want to emit there an instruction that's known to trap. You
can use an `UNIMP` pseudo-instruction, which should trap in nearly all systems.
The *de facto* standard implementation of this instruction is:

- `C.UNIMP`: `0000`. The all-zeroes pattern is not a valid instruction. Any
  system which traps on invalid instructions will thus trap on this `UNIMP`
  instruction form. Despite not being a valid instruction, it still fits the
  16-bit (compressed) instruction format, and so `0000 0000` is interpreted as
  being two 16-bit `UNIMP` instructions.

- `UNIMP` : `C0001073`. This is an alias for `CSRRW x0, cycle, x0`. Since
  `cycle` is a read-only CSR, then (whether this CSR exists or not) an attempt
  to write into it will generate an illegal instruction exception. This 32-bit
  form of `UNIMP` is emitted when targeting a system without the C extension,
  or when the `.option norvc` directive is used.

## Pseudo Ops

Both the RISC-V-specific and GNU .-prefixed options.

## Assembler Relocation Functions

The following table lists assembler relocation expansions:

Assembler Notation          | Description                    | Instruction / Macro
:----------------------     | :---------------               | :-------------------
%hi(symbol)                 | Absolute (HI20)                | lui
%lo(symbol)                 | Absolute (LO12)                | load, store, add
%pcrel_hi(symbol)           | PC-relative (HI20)             | auipc
%pcrel_lo(label)            | PC-relative (LO12)             | load, store, add
%tprel_hi(symbol)           | TLS LE "Local Exec"            | lui
%tprel_lo(symbol)           | TLS LE "Local Exec"            | load, store, add
%tprel_add(symbol)          | TLS LE "Local Exec"            | add

%tls_gd_pcrel_hi(symbol) \* | TLS GD "Global Dynamic" (HI20) | auipc
%got_pcrel_hi(symbol) \*    | GOT PC-relative (HI20)         | auipc

\* These reuse %pcrel_lo(label) for their lower half

Labels
------------

Text labels are used as branch, unconditional jump targets and symbol offsets.
Text labels are added to the symbol table of the compiled module.

```assembly
loop:
        j loop
```

Numeric labels are used for local references. References to local labels are
suffixed with 'f' for a forward reference or 'b' for a backwards reference.

```assembly
1:
        j 1b
```

Absolute addressing
------------------------

The following example shows how to load an absolute address:

```assembly
	lui	a0, %hi(msg + 1)
	addi	a0, a0, %lo(msg + 1)
```

Which generates the following assembler output and relocations
as seen by `objdump`:

```assembly
0000000000000000 <.text>:
   0:	00000537          	lui	a0,0x0
			0: R_RISCV_HI20	msg+0x1
   4:	00150513          	addi	a0,a0,1 # 0x1
			4: R_RISCV_LO12_I	msg+0x1
```

Relative addressing
------------------------

The following example shows how to load a PC-relative address:

```assembly
1:
	auipc	a0, %pcrel_hi(msg + 1)
	addi	a0, a0, %pcrel_lo(1b)
```

Which generates the following assembler output and relocations
as seen by `objdump`:

```assembly
0000000000000000 <.text>:
   0:	00000517          	auipc	a0,0x0
			0: R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20	msg+0x1
   4:	00050513          	mv	a0,a0
			4: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I	.L1
```

GOT-indirect addressing
------------------------

The following example shows how to load an address from the GOT:

```assembly
1:
	auipc	a0, %got_pcrel_hi(msg + 1)
	ld	a0, %pcrel_lo(1b)(a0)
```

Which generates the following assembler output and relocations
as seen by `objdump`:

```assembly
0000000000000000 <.text>:
   0:	00000517          	auipc	a0,0x0
			0: R_RISCV_GOT_HI20	msg+0x1
   4:	00050513          	mv	a0,a0
			4: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I	.L1
```

Load Immediate
-------------------

The following example shows the `li` pseudo instruction which
is used to load immediate values:

```assembly
	.equ	CONSTANT, 0xdeadbeef

	li	a0, CONSTANT
```

Which, for RV32I, generates the following assembler output, as seen by `objdump`:

```assembly
00000000 <.text>:
   0:	deadc537          	lui	a0,0xdeadc
   4:	eef50513          	addi	a0,a0,-273 # deadbeef <CONSTANT+0x0>
```

Load Address
-----------------

The following example shows the `la` pseudo instruction which
is used to load symbol addresses:

```assembly
	la	a0, msg + 1
```

Which generates the following assembler output and relocations
for non-PIC as seen by `objdump`:

```assembly
0000000000000000 <.text>:
   0:	00000517          	auipc	a0,0x0
			0: R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20	msg+0x1
   4:	00050513          	mv	a0,a0
			4: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I	.L0
```

And generates the following assembler output and relocations
for PIC as seen by `objdump`:

```assembly
0000000000000000 <.text>:
   0:	00000517          	auipc	a0,0x0
			0: R_RISCV_GOT_HI20	msg+0x1
   4:	00053503          	ld	a0,0(a0) # 0 <.text>
			4: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I	.L0
```

Load and Store Global
---------------------

The following pseudo instructions are available to load from and store to
global objects:

  * `l{b|h|w|d} <rd>, <symbol>`: load byte, half word, word or double word from global[^1]
  * `s{b|h|w|d} <rd>, <symbol>, <rt>`: store byte, half word, word or double word to global[^2]
  * `fl{h|w|d|q} <rd>, <symbol>, <rt>`: load half, float, double or quad precision from global[^2]
  * `fs{h|w|d|q} <rd>, <symbol>, <rt>`: store half, float, double or quad precision to global[^2]

[^1]: the first operand is implicitly used as a scratch register.
[^2]: the last operand specifies the scratch register to be used.

The following example shows how these pseudo instructions are used:

```assembly
	lw	a0, var1
	fld	fa0, var2, t0
	sw	a0, var3, t0
	fsd	fa0, var4, t0
```

Which generates the following assembler output and relocations
as seen by `objdump`:

```
0000000000000000 <.text>:
   0:	00000517          	auipc	a0,0x0
			0: R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20	var1
   4:	00052503          	lw	a0,0(a0) # 0 <.text>
			4: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I	.L0
   8:	00000297          	auipc	t0,0x0
			8: R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20	var2
   c:	0002b507          	fld	fa0,0(t0) # 8 <.text+0x8>
			c: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I	.L0
  10:	00000297          	auipc	t0,0x0
			10: R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20	var3
  14:	00a2a023          	sw	a0,0(t0) # 10 <.text+0x10>
			14: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S	.L0
  18:	00000297          	auipc	t0,0x0
			18: R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20	var4
  1c:	00a2b027          	fsd	fa0,0(t0) # 18 <.text+0x18>
			1c: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S	.L0
```

Constants
--------------

The following example shows loading a constant using the `%hi` and
`%lo` assembler functions.

```assembly
	.equ	UART_BASE, 0x40003080

	lui	a0, %hi(UART_BASE)
	addi	a0, a0, %lo(UART_BASE)
```

Which generates the following assembler output
as seen by `objdump`:

```assembly
0000000000000000 <.text>:
   0:	40003537          	lui	a0,0x40003
   4:	08050513          	addi	a0,a0,128 # 40003080 <UART_BASE>
```

Function Calls
--------------

The following pseudo instructions are available to call subroutines far from
the current position:

  * `call	<symbol>`: call away subroutine[^1]
  * `call	<rd>, <symbol>`: call away subroutine[^2]
  * `tail	<symbol>`: tail call away subroutine[^3]
  * `jump	<symbol>, <rt>`: jump to away routine[^4]

[^1]: `ra` is implicitly used to save the return address.
[^2]: similar to `call <symbol>`, but `<rd>` is used to save the return address instead.
[^3]: `t1` is implicitly used as a scratch register.
[^4]: similar to `tail <symbol>`, but `<rt>` is used as the scratch register instead.

The following example shows how these pseudo instructions are used:

```assembly
	call	func1
	tail	func2
	jump	func3, t0
```

Which generates the following assembler output and relocations
as seen by `objdump`:

```
0000000000000000 <.text>:
   0:	00000097          	auipc	ra,0x0
			0: R_RISCV_CALL	func1
   4:	000080e7          	jalr	ra # 0x0
   8:	00000317          	auipc	t1,0x0
			8: R_RISCV_CALL	func2
   c:	00030067          	jr	t1 # 0x8
  10:	00000297          	auipc	t0,0x0
			10: R_RISCV_CALL	func3
  14:	00028067          	jr	t0 # 0x10
```

Floating-point rounding modes
-----------------------------

For floating-point instructions with a rounding mode field, the rounding mode
can be specified by adding an additional operand. e.g. `fcvt.w.s` with
round-to-zero can be written as `fcvt.w.s a0, fa0, rtz`. If unspecified, the
default `dyn` rounding mode will be used.

Supported rounding modes are as follows (must be specified in lowercase):
* `rne`: round to nearest, ties to even
* `rtz`: round towards zero
* `rdn`: round down
* `rup`: round up
* `rmm`: round to nearest, ties to max magnitude
* `dyn`: dynamic rounding mode (the rounding mode specified in the `frm` field
of the `fcsr` register is used)

Control and Status Registers
---------------------------------

The following code sample shows how to enable timer interrupts,
set and wait for a timer interrupt to occur:

```assembly
.equ RTC_BASE,      0x40000000
.equ TIMER_BASE,    0x40004000
