== Building the Document

=== Directory Structure

The following directories are used to organize the contents of this repo:

* `dependencies/`: software dependencies needed to build the specification
* `docs-resources/`: resources for all specifications sourced from link:.gitmodules[git submodule]
* `src/`: source files for the specification
* `build/`: default directory where the build artifacts are generated

=== Prerequisites

To build the document, you'll need the following tools installed on your system:

* Make
* asciiDoctor-pdf
* Docker

=== Cloning the Repository

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual.git
```

All in one single line:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual.git && cd riscv-asm-manual && git submodule update --init --recursive

```

=== Building the Documentation

To start the build process, run:

```shell
cd ./riscv-asm-manual && make build
```

The link:Makefile[] script will check the availability of Docker on your system:

* If Docker is available, the documentation will be built inside a Docker container using the image riscvintl/riscv-docs-base-container-image:latest. This ensures a consistent build environment across different systems.
* If Docker is not available, the documentation will be built directly on your system using the installed tools.

The documentation is generated from the AsciiDoctor source files in your project. The primary source file is specified by the `HEADER_SOURCE` variable in the Makefile.

The build process utilizes several options, including theming and font settings, and generates a PDF document as output.

=== Cleaning up

To clean up the generated files, run:

```shell
make clean
```

== Enabling pre-commit checks locally

The repository has some basic commit checks set up with https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] that will be enforced by the GitHub CI.
To ensure these checks are also run in the local repository while making changes the following can be done:

.Installing pre-commit tool
[source,shell]
----
# Do once on your system
pip3 install pre-commit
----

.Installing pre-commit git hook in repo
[source,shell]
----
# Do once in local repo
pre-commit install
----

Rather than doing the above `pre-commit install` in every repo that uses it, you can do it https://pre-commit.com/#automatically-enabling-pre-commit-on-repositories[once on your system.]

When enabling additional checks https://pre-commit.com/#plugins[by editing .pre-commit-config.yaml], it is recommended running the newly added check on all files in the repository. This can be done with the following command:

.Running all pre-commit hooks on all files
[source,shell]
----
pre-commit run --all-files
----
